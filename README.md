## 📷 Sample Output

```
************Calculator for Scientific Operations************

Choose any Operation...
       1 : Arithmetic Operations
       2 : Trigonometric Functions
       3 : Logarithmic Functions
       4 : Power Functions
       5 : Root Functions
       6 : Exit
```

User can then perform multiple operations continuously by pressing **Y/y** to continue.
